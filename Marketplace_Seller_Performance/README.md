# 🏪 Marketplace Seller Performance Optimization

## 👋 Overview

This project focuses on improving marketplace efficiency by enhancing seller visibility, optimizing product discovery, and increasing buyer engagement.

As a two-sided marketplace, success depends on balancing **buyer experience and seller performance**. This project targets both sides to drive sustainable growth.

---

## 🎯 Product Goal

Increase seller conversion and reduce seller churn by improving how buyers discover and engage with products.

---

## ⭐ North Star Metric

**Seller Success Rate**
(Successful transactions per active seller)

---

## 🛡️ Guardrail Metrics

* Buyer Satisfaction (engagement rate)
* Bounce Rate
* Session Duration
* Product Return Rate

---

## 🔍 Problem

Sellers experienced low visibility and inconsistent performance due to inefficient product discovery and navigation challenges.

**Key Issues Identified:**

* Poor product categorization
* Friction in navigation and filtering
* Limited visibility for relevant sellers
* Weak buyer-to-seller matching

---

## 📊 Baseline Metrics

* Seller Conversion Rate: **18%**
* Seller Churn Rate: **22%**
* Product Visibility (CTR): **9%**
* Buyer Engagement Rate: **35%**
* Transactions per Seller: **2.1/month**

---

## 🧠 Hypothesis

If we improve navigation, product categorization, and seller visibility, buyers will find relevant products faster—leading to increased seller conversions, higher engagement, and reduced churn.

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

* Seller Conversion Rate
* Seller Churn Rate
* Product Visibility (CTR)
* Buyer Engagement
* Transactions per Seller

---

## 🚀 Solutions Implemented

### 🔎 Category & Navigation Optimization

* Restructured product categories for clarity
* Simplified browsing and filtering experience
* Reduced friction in discovery flow

---

### 📈 Seller Visibility Enhancements

* Improved ranking logic for relevant products
* Highlighted high-performing and relevant sellers
* Increased exposure for underperforming sellers with strong relevance

---

### 🎨 UX & Discoverability Improvements

* Redesigned product listing layout
* Improved information hierarchy
* Enhanced filtering and sorting usability

---

## 🧪 Experimentation (A/B Testing)

**Experiment Goal:** Improve seller conversion and buyer engagement

**Test Design:**

* **Control:** Existing navigation and product listing experience
* **Variant:** Optimized navigation + enhanced seller visibility + improved layout
* **Sample Size:** ~12,000 users
* **Duration:** 2 weeks

**Results:**

* Seller Conversion Rate: **18% → 20.7% (+15%)**
* Seller Churn Rate: **22% → 19.4% (-12%)**
* Product Visibility (CTR): **9% → 10.8% (+20%)**
* Buyer Engagement: **35% → 42% (+20%)**
* Transactions per Seller: **2.1 → 2.6/month (+24%)**

---

## ⚙️ Execution (Agile / Jira)

* Defined epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria
* Prioritized backlog using impact vs effort
* Managed sprint planning and execution
* Broke features into clear engineering subtasks
* Tracked progress across:

  * Idea → To Do → In Progress → Testing → Done

---

## ⚖️ Tradeoffs & Decision-Making

* Prioritized navigation and visibility improvements over pricing changes due to faster implementation and higher impact on discovery
* Focused on high-reach improvements affecting both buyers and sellers
* Deferred advanced ranking algorithms due to higher complexity and longer development time
* Balanced seller visibility improvements with buyer experience to avoid overwhelming users
