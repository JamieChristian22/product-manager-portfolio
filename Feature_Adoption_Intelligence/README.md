# Feature Adoption Intelligence – Product Case Study

## Overview
This case study demonstrates how product analytics, user research, and experimentation were used to increase adoption of a newly launched feature within a digital product environment. The project simulates a real-world Product Manager workflow from discovery to outcome measurement.
