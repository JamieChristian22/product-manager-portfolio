# User Journey to First Purchase

## Project Overview  
This case study focuses on analyzing and optimizing the user journey from initial signup to first purchase. It explores activation funnels, time-to-value metrics, and friction points that prevent users from converting, with the goal of increasing first-purchase rates and accelerating the time to revenue.

---

## Problem Statement  
Many users sign up but do not complete their first purchase within the first week.  
This results in delayed revenue, poor activation metrics, and lower overall retention.

**Goal:**  
Understand the drop-off points, design product improvements, and improve time-to-first-purchase and overall conversion.
