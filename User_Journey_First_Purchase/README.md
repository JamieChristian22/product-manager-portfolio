# 🧭 User Journey Optimization – First Purchase Conversion

## 👋 Overview

This project focuses on optimizing the end-to-end user journey to increase first purchase conversion.

By analyzing user behavior across the funnel, identifying friction points, and implementing targeted improvements, this project drives measurable gains in conversion, engagement, and revenue.

---

## 🎯 Product Goal

Increase first purchase conversion by reducing friction and improving user experience across key funnel stages.

---

## ⭐ North Star Metric

**First Purchase Conversion Rate**

---

## 🛡️ Guardrail Metrics

* Bounce Rate
* Cart Abandonment Rate
* Session Duration
* Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)

---

## 🔍 Problem

A large percentage of new users were failing to complete their first purchase.

**Key Issues Identified:**

* High friction in product discovery
* Lack of trust and clarity on product pages
* Drop-off during checkout
* Cognitive overload for first-time users

---

## 📊 Funnel Analysis (Baseline)

| Funnel Stage               | Conversion |
| -------------------------- | ---------- |
| Landing → Browse           | 65%        |
| Browse → Product View      | 50%        |
| Product View → Add to Cart | 32%        |
| Cart → Checkout            | 70%        |
| Checkout → Purchase        | 55%        |

👉 **Biggest Drop-Offs:**

* Product View → Add to Cart
* Checkout → Purchase

---

## 🧠 Key Insight (User Behavior)

Users were not reaching the **“confidence point”** needed to make a purchase.

* Lack of trust signals reduced conversions
* Decision friction slowed purchase behavior
* Users needed clearer guidance and reassurance

---

## 🧠 Hypothesis

If we reduce friction, improve trust signals, and guide users more effectively through the funnel, first purchase conversion will increase significantly.
