# 🔁 SaaS Retention & Churn Reduction

## 👋 Overview

This project focuses on improving user retention and reducing churn in a SaaS product by optimizing onboarding, increasing feature adoption, and implementing proactive engagement strategies.

Retention is critical in SaaS—long-term growth depends on keeping users engaged and continuously delivering value.

---

## 🎯 Product Goal

Reduce churn and increase user retention by improving early user experience and long-term engagement.

---

## ⭐ North Star Metric

**User Retention Rate (30-day retention)**

---

## 🛡️ Guardrail Metrics

* Churn Rate
* Daily Active Users (DAU)
* Feature Adoption Rate
* Session Duration
* Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)

---

## 🔍 Problem

Users were dropping off early in their lifecycle, leading to high churn and reduced lifetime value.

**Key Issues Identified:**

* Weak onboarding experience
* Low feature adoption
* Lack of user engagement after signup
* No proactive retention strategy

---

## 📊 Baseline Metrics

* 30-Day Retention Rate: **42%**
* Churn Rate: **28%**
* Feature Adoption Rate: **35%**
* Daily Active Users (DAU): **2,100**
* Avg Session Duration: **6.5 min**

---

## 🧠 Hypothesis

If we improve onboarding, guide users toward key features, and proactively re-engage inactive users, retention will increase and churn will decrease.

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

* Retention Rate
* Churn Rate
* Feature Adoption Rate
* DAU / Engagement
* Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

---

## 👤 User Journey Insight

Analysis showed most churn occurred during:

* First 3–7 days (onboarding phase)
* After initial feature exploration

👉 Insight: Users were not reaching the “aha moment” quickly enough.

---

## 🚀 Solutions Implemented

### 🚀 Onboarding Optimization

* Introduced guided onboarding flow
* Highlighted key features early
* Created “first success milestone” for users

---

### 🔔 Feature Adoption Nudges

* In-app prompts to guide feature usage
* Email reminders for inactive users
* Personalized feature recommendations

---

### 📣 Proactive Engagement Strategy

* Re-engagement emails for inactive users
* Usage-based alerts and reminders
* Targeted messaging based on behavior

---

### 📊 Feedback & Insights Loop

* Implemented NPS surveys
* Captured user feedback for product improvements
* Closed feedback loop with updates

---

## 🧪 Experimentation (A/B Testing)

**Experiment Goal:** Improve onboarding and increase feature adoption

**Test Design:**

* **Control:** Existing onboarding flow
* **Variant:** Guided onboarding + feature nudges
* **Sample Size:** ~10,000 users
* **Duration:** 3 weeks
