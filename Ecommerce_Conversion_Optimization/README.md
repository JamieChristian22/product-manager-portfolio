# 🛒 Ecommerce Conversion Optimization

## 👋 Overview

This project focuses on improving ecommerce conversion by optimizing product discovery, enhancing user experience, and leveraging data-driven personalization.

The goal is to increase **purchases per session**, the North Star metric driving revenue growth.

## 🎯 Product Goal

Increase conversion rate and average order value by improving how users discover and interact with products.

## ⭐ North Star Metric

**Purchases per session**

---

## 🔍 Problem

Users struggled to find relevant products quickly, leading to:

* High bounce rates
* Low conversion rates
* Poor engagement with product listings

**Baseline Metrics:**

* Conversion Rate: **2.5%**
* Average Order Value (AOV): **$52**
* Bounce Rate: **48%**
* Product Views per Session: **4.1**
