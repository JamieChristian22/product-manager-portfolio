# 💰 Revenue Pricing Strategy Optimization

## 👋 Overview

This project focuses on optimizing pricing strategy to maximize revenue, improve profit margins, and balance customer acquisition with long-term retention.

Pricing is a critical growth lever. This project applies **data analysis, experimentation, and financial modeling** to identify optimal pricing strategies across customer segments.

---

## 🎯 Product Goal

Increase revenue and profit margins while maintaining sustainable conversion and retention.

---

## ⭐ North Star Metric

**Revenue per User (RPU)**

---

## 🛡️ Guardrail Metrics

* Conversion Rate
* Customer Retention Rate
* Churn Rate
* Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)

---

## 🔍 Problem

The existing pricing model was not aligned with customer value and demand, leading to:

* Missed revenue opportunities
* Suboptimal margins
* Inefficient discounting
* Lack of pricing experimentation

---

## 📊 Baseline Metrics

* Revenue per User: **$48**
* Conversion Rate: **3.2%**
* Profit Margin: **22%**
* Retention Rate: **68%**
* Average Discount Rate: **18%**

---

## 🧠 Hypothesis

If pricing is aligned with customer willingness to pay and product value, revenue and margins will increase—even with a slight decrease in conversion.

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

* Revenue per User (RPU)
* Profit Margin
* Conversion Rate
* Retention Rate
* Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

---

## 👥 Customer Segmentation (Key Insight)

Users were segmented based on behavior and sensitivity to price:

* **Price-Sensitive Users:** High conversion, low margin
* **Value-Driven Users:** Moderate conversion, high retention
* **Premium Users:** Lower conversion, highest margin

👉 Insight: Uniform pricing was underpricing premium users and over-discounting price-sensitive segments.

---

## 📈 Pricing Strategy Decisions

### 💡 Tiered Pricing Model

* Introduced differentiated pricing tiers based on user segments
* Aligned price with perceived value

---

### 📊 Demand & Elasticity-Based Pricing

* Identified price sensitivity across segments
* Adjusted pricing to optimize revenue vs volume

---

### 🧮 Discount Optimization

* Reduced blanket discounts
* Targeted promotions based on behavior
* Improved margin efficiency

---

### 📈 Revenue Modeling

* Built scenarios to evaluate:

  * Revenue vs conversion tradeoffs
  * Margin impact
  * Long-term customer value

---

## 🧪 Experimentation (A/B Testing)

**Experiment Goal:** Identify optimal pricing structure to maximize revenue and margin

**Test Design:**

* **Control:** Existing flat pricing model
* **Variant A:** Tiered pricing by segment
* **Variant B:** Elasticity-adjusted pricing
* **Sample Size:** ~15,000 users
* **Duration:** 3 weeks

## ⚙️ Execution (Agile / Jira)

* Defined pricing experiments as user stories
* Prioritized initiatives using impact vs effort
* Collaborated with data and engineering teams
* Managed sprint execution and delivery

---

## ⚖️ Tradeoffs & Decision-Making

* Accepted a **slight decrease in conversion (-6%)** to achieve:

  * Higher revenue (+10%)
  * Stronger margins (+8 pts)
* Prioritized long-term profitability over short-term volume
* Avoided aggressive price increases that could harm retention
* Balanced revenue growth with customer experience

---
